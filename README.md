- Hi, I’m @possumcr0ss. I go by Vesper, or V for short. 
- I’m interested in Reptiles, Pokémon, Traditional Art and gruesome things.
- Coding isn't a important thing to me so I'm going through the basics currently and hope to expand. I am 100% open to someone teaching me. I would also love to help out by making some art.
- The easiest way to reach out to me is through my Twitter DM's (possum_cr0ss). Fell free to contact me, I don't bite.
